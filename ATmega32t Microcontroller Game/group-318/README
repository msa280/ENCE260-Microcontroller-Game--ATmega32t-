Step 1: You will see a display on the screen after starting the game. This display 
        specifies the game's name and gives credits to the authors. Push the navswitch
        to progress.

Step 2: The blue led turns off to indicate the start of the game. Before each game level,
        the level number of the game is shown constantly. Push navswitch to start the 
        game.

Step 3: You will be shown a series of dots on the LED display. These dots are bombs placed
        on a 5x7 grid. The order of the bombs is randomised. Please memorize the positions of
        the bombs on the grid. Once you are sure of the bombs, push navswitch to progress.

Step 4: All the leds would turn off except the one on the bottom most row. That is your players 
        current position. Use the Navswitch to move the player on the grid to find the bombs.
        Once you are sure of the bomb's position, push the navswitch to defuse the bomb.

Step 5: If the bomb existed on that position, the blue led would blink 3 times. If you 
        reselect the bomb position that has already been found, the blue led would blink once
        to indicate that the bomb on that position has already been diffused. Once all the bombs 
        in a level have been diffused, you can progress to the next level. There are a 
        maximum of 10 levels.

Step 6: If the bomb doesn't exist in the position the player chose, the player would loose and
        the blue led would blink vigiourously. This is followed by a "GAME OVER" screen. Push
        the navswitch to see your score. Once done, push navswitch again to stop the game.
